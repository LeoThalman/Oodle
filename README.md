# Welcome

Welcome to the Blackwood Repository. This repository primarily houses the code for our main project, Oodle, along with all the files created through out our planning, the company files, and the code from
another project known as Track Run.

## Class Project 

The class project was a team building exercise to help us strengthen our ability to develop software using an AGILE development process. While it was never completed (which was intentional) 
The concept behind it was a website that could be used by a coach to track their athlete's workouts using data from a .FIT file. Only two weeks were spent working on it and only the landing page, 
file upload, file parsing, and a database were finished. 

The following is the vision statement for the project.

### Vision Statement

> For Student athletes and their coaches who want to be able to visualize and better understand their own personal and group cross country workout plans as well as set goals, show health based statistics, and make comments on one’s progress, the Student Running System is an information system that will provide a clean user interface for coaches and students to view information such as time, distance, elevation changes and heart rate during a run. Students and coaches will also be able to set goals and view detailed schedules in a weekly or monthly format in order to help achieve goals created for students in order to help them become better runners. The System will save students and coaches time and effort by giving them an updated version of many of the current software or systems in place by giving more options in a single centralized location. Unlike the current sites and manual ways of planning and viewing running data, our product will show the information in a much cleaner way as well as give students and coaches more options than ever before to better help obtain goals, improve and monitor health, and collaborate with others.

## Oodle 

Oodle is a learning management system that takes many of the features of already existing programs and offers them in an easier to use and cleaner manner. Oodle is still currently a work in progress, 
but more will be added to this section as it is developed.

If you have any questions about our company, email us at wleingang15@mail.wou.edu. 


## Contributing

Oodle is an open source project, so anyone can contribute. However, we will not be accepting pull requests until after June 15th, 2018. At this point, the first full release of the website will be finished
and the project opened to public contributions. If you want to help us by adding to our codebase or fixing bugs at this time, please feel free to. Once again, if you have any questions, send them wleingang15@mail.wou.edu.


### Getting Started

If this is your first time coding using a forked repository and pull requests to contribute to a project, I highly recommend using 
[this](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow) tutorial. It walks you through step by step instructions on everything from initially forking the repository to
making your first pull request. 


### Programming Conventions

Right now, we haven't agreed upon any conventions we will be using, be it naming conventions of views or how comments should be formatted. However, this will be updated in the near future to include
a fairly detailed description of how code needs to look before being accepted into this project. 


### Tools and Packages

I honestly don't know for this section. I'll work on adding stuff here later.
