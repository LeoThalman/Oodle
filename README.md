# Class Project 

The class project was a team building exercise to help us strengthen our ability to develop software using an AGILE development process. While it was never completed (which was intentional) 
The concept behind it was a website that could be used by a coach to track their athlete's workouts using data from a .FIT file. Only two weeks were spent working on it and only the landing page, 
file upload, file parsing, and a database were finished. 

The following is the vision statement for the project.

### Vision Statement

> For Student athletes and their coaches who want to be able to visualize and better understand their own personal and group cross country workout plans as well as set goals, show health based statistics, and make comments on one's progress, the Student Running System is an information system that will provide a clean user interface for coaches and students to view information such as time, distance, elevation changes and heart rate during a run. Students and coaches will also be able to set goals and view detailed schedules in a weekly or monthly format in order to help achieve goals created for students in order to help them become better runners. The System will save students and coaches time and effort by giving them an updated version of many of the current software or systems in place by giving more options in a single centralized location. Unlike the current sites and manual ways of planning and viewing running data, our product will show the information in a much cleaner way as well as give students and coaches more options than ever before to better help obtain goals, improve and monitor health, and collaborate with others.

# Oodle 

Oodle is a learning management system that takes many of the features of already existing programs and offers them in an easier to use and cleaner manner. Oodle is still currently a work in progress, 
but more will be added to this section as it is developed.

### Vision Statement

> For students and educators who want to be able to manage, learn, and teach in 
online classrooms. Cleanliness and efficiency would be paramount vs current 
solutions. Our system would not have to rely on the support of IT or outside 
resources. The Oodle System is a web-based learning management system that can 
provide a clean and simple user interface for students and educators to create 
an online classroom quickly and easily. The system gives anyone the ability to 
create a class hosted in thecloud that gives teachers of a class the ability to 
provide quizzes, post andgrade assignments, communicate with students efficiently 
all while providing a simple and clean user interface. The Oodle system will save 
time and effort by setting up a more simplified, efficient, and user friendly 
learning management system compared to the current software such as Blackboard or 
Moodle. Unlike the current learning management systems, our product and its 
classrooms are  hosted in the cloud and will give the ability to easily create 
and enroll in a class. In addition, eliminates the need for an IT department
or external set up and configuration. Oodle is not open to customization by end
users and limits its core features to only the essentials to help give a more
intuitive experience to the consumer.

# Contributing

Oodle is an open source project, so anyone can contribute. However, we will not be accepting pull requests until after June 15th, 2018. At this point, the first full release of the website will be finished
and the project opened to public contributions. If you want to help us by adding to our codebase or fixing bugs at this time, please feel free to. Once again, if you have any questions, send them wleingang15@mail.wou.edu.

When contributing to this file, please add your name to the [contributors file](https://bitbucket.org/blackwood-incorporated/senior-project/contributors.md).



### Getting Started

If this is your first time coding using a forked repository and pull requests to contribute to a project, I highly recommend using 
[this](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow) tutorial. It walks you through step by step instructions on everything from initially forking the repository to
making your first pull request. 


### Programming Conventions

When contributing to this project, you must follow these programming and stylistic 
guidelines. 

#### C# Coding Conventions

The majority of code in this project is in C#. These guidelines outline how your code should
be written with examples. They are based off of the guidelines written by Microsoft, which can be found 
[here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions).


* Semicolons belong on their own line. 

```C
public static double Divide(double a, double b)
{
    return a / b;
}
```

* Methods must have a short, one to two sentence description commented above them.

```C
// Divides a double by another and returns the result
public static double Divide(double a, double b)
{
    return a / b;
}
```


#### C# Naming Conventions

* PascalCasing should be used for all public member, type, and namespace names consisting of multiple words.

```C
public class StreamReader 
{
    ... 
}
```

* camelCasing should be used for parameter names.

```C
public class Convert { 
    public static int ToInt32(string value); 
}
```

#### Git Procedure

* Always have a seperate branch for each feature you are working on.
* Tests commits before pushing updates. 
* Commit messages should provide some useful insight into what changes were made, but should be short and simple.



### Software Development Process

This project is being developed using Scrum, which is an Agile Framework. We work
in two week sprints. However, while we highly recommend using this process, you are
not required to code this way to contribute to the project.


### Tools and Packages

This section is blank for now, but contents will be added to this as the information is learned.
