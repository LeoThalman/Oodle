                    Oodle is a learning management system that takes many of
                    the features of already existing programs and offers them
                    in an easier to use and cleaner manner. Oodle is still
                    currently a work in progress, but more will be added to
                    this section as it is developed.

                    For students and educators who want to be able to manage, learn, and teach
                    in online classrooms. Cleanliness and efficiency would be paramount vs current
                    solutions. Our system would not have to rely on the support of IT or outside
                    resources. The Oodle System is a web-based learning management system that can
                    provide a clean and simple user interface for students and educators to create
                    an online classroom quickly and easily. The system gives anyone the ability to
                    create a class hosted in thecloud that gives teachers of a class the ability to
                    provide quizzes, post andgrade assignments, communicate with students efficiently
                    all while providing a simple and clean user interface. The Oodle system will save
                    time and effort by setting up a more simplified, efficient, and user friendly learning
                    management system compared to the current software such as Blackboard or Moodle.
                    Unlike the current learning management systems, our product and its classrooms
                    are hosted in the cloud and will give the ability to easily create and enroll
                    in a class. In addition, eliminates the need for an IT department or external
                    set up and configuration. Oodle is not open to customization by end users and
                    limits its core features to only the essentials to help give a more intuitive
                    experience to the consumer.
